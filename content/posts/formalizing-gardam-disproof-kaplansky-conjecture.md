A little over an year ago, Giles Gardam disproved a long-standing conjecture, often called the _Kaplansky Unit Conjecture_. This was a striking result -- the statement was a simple and basic one, it had a long history, and it was one of a cluster of related conjectures with important relations to many areas (including the Whitehead conjecture in topology). 

Anand Tadipatri and I have formalized Gardam's disproof in `lean 4`. We used `lean 4` as a proof assistant, but also took advantage of its being a (full fledged and really nice) programming language. This post is an account of the Unit conjecture and our formalization of it.

## Whys: formalize? lean 4? Gardam's theorem?

A superb account of why we should formalize is the article [Why formalize mathematics?](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~pmassot/files/exposition/why_formalize.pdf) by Patrick Massot.
