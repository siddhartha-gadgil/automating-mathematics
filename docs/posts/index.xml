      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is to celebrate the &lt;a href=&#34;https://abelprize.no/abel-prize-laureates/2022&#34;&gt;Abel prize&lt;/a&gt; awarded to Dennis Sullivan. Sullivan is not only one of the deepest and broadest mathematicians, but also one of the most inspiring &amp;ndash; in particular to me. I learnt much from him during my three years at Stony Brook and during his two visits to India. This is a somewhat whimsical account of some of this, with quotes from memory (hence error prone).  Some stuff is general and some more technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since much of this is about the process of mathematics it should also be useful for automated theorem proving &amp;ndash; my excuse for posting this here ðŸ˜ƒ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Forward Reasoning in Lean 4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I describe here my experiments with &lt;em&gt;forward reasoning&lt;/em&gt; (reasoning from the premises), as well as &lt;em&gt;mixed reasoning&lt;/em&gt; (reasoning both from the premises and from the conclusion) in Lean 4. The code for this is in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/lean-loris&#34;&gt;Lean-Loris&lt;/a&gt; repository. This code (and especially the ideas in it) is a successor to my scala code in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/ProvingGround&#34;&gt;ProvingGround&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) asks whether a finite set of formulas in Boolean (i.e., true or false valued) variables $P$, $Q$,&amp;hellip; has a solution. The formulas are built from the variables using logical operations such as $\vee$ (and), $\wedge$ (or) and $\neg$ (not).</description>

      <title>Sat Solving</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To better understand the &lt;code&gt;SAT&lt;/code&gt; (i.e., &lt;em&gt;boolean satisfiability&lt;/em&gt;) problem and &lt;code&gt;SAT&lt;/code&gt; solvers, I decided to implement a basic one. I was pleasantly surprised that wikipedia has enough details to implement the so called &lt;strong&gt;DPLL&lt;/strong&gt; algorithm quite easily, with even some improvements described in wikipedia. Even better, in the case when there was no solution, the same algorithm gives a proof that there is no solution. The proof that there is no solution was based on &lt;em&gt;resolution&lt;/em&gt; due to Davis-Putnam â€” so the algorithm gives as a bonus a proof that resolution is refutation complete for propositional calculus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving (but not proving?) Pappus</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to some very nice work done by Anand Tadipatri after he read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://siddhartha-gadgil.github.io/automating-mathematics/posts/proving-by-solving/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; on proving theorems using SMT solvers, we find that in a sense the theorem of Pappus can be &lt;strong&gt;solved&lt;/strong&gt; (but, so far at least, in some sense not &lt;strong&gt;proved&lt;/strong&gt;) by &lt;strong&gt;Z3&lt;/strong&gt;  â€” a happier conclusion than last time. I make this precise below, assuming the reader is familiar with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://siddhartha-gadgil.github.io/automating-mathematics/posts/proving-by-solving/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Computers are able to solve an increasing range of problems, many of which were believed not long ago to require human intelligence. Yet there are fundamental limitations to what problems can be solved algorithmically, some known and other conjectured.</description>

      <description>Formal verification, a rapidly growing young field, is the computer assisted proving of results - ordinary mathematical theorems, as well as claims that pieces of hardware or software, network protocols, and mechanical and hybrid systems meet their specifications.</description>
